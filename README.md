# 54321 Grounding App

## About
The 54321 Grounding App is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users manage anxiety, stress, and overwhelming emotions through the evidence-based 54321 grounding technique. This mindfulness exercise helps bring your attention to the present moment by engaging your five senses sequentially.

## How It Works
The app presents a series of beautifully illustrated cards, each representing one of the five senses. Users can swipe through each step:
- 5 things you can SEE
- 4 things you can TOUCH/FEEL
- 3 things you can HEAR
- 2 things you can SMELL
- 1 thing you can TASTE

Each card provides clear instructions and engaging visuals to guide users through the exercise.

## Benefits
Research has shown that grounding techniques like the 54321 method can:
- Reduce anxiety and panic symptoms by activating the parasympathetic nervous system
- Help manage PTSD symptoms and flashbacks
- Improve present-moment awareness and mindfulness
- Decrease stress levels by lowering cortisol production
- Enhance emotional regulation and self-soothing capabilities
- Provide a portable coping strategy for various situations

## Scientific Background
The 54321 technique combines several evidence-based therapeutic approaches:
- Sensory awareness from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
- Attention redirection from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- Body awareness from Somatic Experiencing
- Present-moment focus from mindfulness practices
